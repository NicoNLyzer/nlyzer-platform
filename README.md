        self.redis_client = redis.Redis()
        self.conversation_state = ConversationState()
        self.active_agent = None

    async def process_multimodal_input(
          self, 
          text: Optional[str] = None,
          image: Optional[bytes] = None
      ):
          # Determine intent and route to appropriate agent
          if image and not text:
              self.active_agent = VisualDiscoveryAgent(self.store_id)
          elif "trip" in text.lower() or "travel" in text.lower():
              self.active_agent = DestinationCommerceAgent(self.store_id)

          # Process through selected agent
          response = await self.active_agent.process(
              text=text,
              image=image,

## üîß Python-Based Technical Implementation

### Agent Architecture Example

```python
class DestinationCommerceAgent:
    def __init__(self, store_id: str):
        self.store_id = store_id
        self.weather_service = WeatherIntelligenceService()
        self.cultural_db = CulturalContextDatabase()
        self.product_matcher = ProductMatcher(store_id)

    async def process(self, text: str, context: ConversationState):
        # Extract destination
        destination = self.extract_destination(text)

        if not context.get("travel_dates"):
            return {
                "response": f"Great! When are you planning to visit {destination}?",
                "expecting": "dates",
                "agent_state": "collecting_dates"
            }

        # Get weather forecast
        weather = await self.weather_service.get_historical_forecast(
            destination,
            context["travel_dates"]
        )

        # Get cultural context
        cultural_notes = await self.cultural_db.get_destination_context(
            destination
        )

        # Generate outfit recommendations
        recommendations = await self.generate_travel_wardrobe(
            destination=destination,
            weather=weather,
            cultural_context=cultural_notes,
            customer_style=context.get("style_preferences"),
            store_inventory=self.store_id
        )

        return {
            "response": f"Based on {destination}'s weather in {context['travel_dates']} "
                       f"(average {weather['temp']}¬∞F), here's what I recommend:",
            "products": recommendations,
            "context_used": {
                "weather": weather,
                "cultural_notes": cultural_notes
            },
            "follow_up_questions": [
                "What activities are you planning?",
                "Do you prefer lighter or heavier fabrics?",
                "What's your budget for the trip wardrobe?"
            ]
        }
```

### Visual Search Implementation

```python
class VisualDiscoveryAgent:
    def __init__(self, store_id: str):
        self.store_id = store_id
        self.vision_processor = MultimodalImageProcessor()
        self.embedding_model = CLIPModel()
        self.vector_db = QdrantClient()

    async def find_similar_products(self, image: bytes):
        # Extract visual features
        visual_analysis = await self.vision_processor.process_customer_image(image)

        # Generate embeddings
        image_embedding = await self.embedding_model.encode_image(image)

        # Search only within store's products
        similar_products = await self.vector_db.search(
            collection=f"store_{self.store_id}_products",
            query_vector=image_embedding,
            limit=20,
            score_threshold=0.7
        )

        # Enhance with style matching
        enhanced_results = []
        for product in similar_products:
            style_match = self.calculate_style_similarity(
                visual_analysis.style_profile,
                product.style_attributes
            )
            enhanced_results.append({
                "product": product,
                "visual_similarity": product.score,
                "style_match": style_match,
                "overall_match": (product.score + style_match) / 2
            })

        return sorted(enhanced_results, key=lambda x: x["overall_match"], reverse=True)
```

## üöÄ Growth Strategy with Commerce Agents

### The Initial MVP (First Customer Ship)
The absolute first version of the product will focus exclusively on the Starter Tier functionality. It will consist of:
- A Stripe checkout page
- A manual onboarding process where the founder ingests the first clients' product data
- The core visual search widget with Visual Discovery Agent only

This stripped-down version validates the core value proposition before automating the full multi-tenant provisioning.

### Initial Go-to-Market (GTM) Strategy
The first 50 customers will be acquired through a targeted strategy focusing on the Shopify App Store. We will create a compelling app listing and leverage Shopify's marketplace to reach merchants actively looking for conversion-boosting solutions. This will be supplemented by direct outreach to boutique fashion and home decor brands on platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn.

**Key GTM tactics:**
- **Shopify App Store Optimization**: Compelling listing with video demos
- **Direct Outreach**: Target 10 boutique stores daily via Instagram DM
