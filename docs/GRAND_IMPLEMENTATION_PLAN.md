## INTRODUCTION: How to Use This Document

**Dear CEO,** this document is your complete script for building NLyzer. You will:
1. Read each step sequentially 
2. Execute every "CEO Action Item" personally
3. Copy-paste every "AI-PM Prompt" to your AI Developer exactly as written
4. Verify each step's success criteria before proceeding
5. Never skip steps or assume anything is "obvious"

**Critical Rules:**
- ❌ **NEVER** skip a CEO Action Item
- ❌ **NEVER** modify an AI-PM Prompt without understanding the consequences
- ✅ **ALWAYS** wait for verification before proceeding to the next step
- ✅ **ALWAYS** keep your secret vault and .env file updated

## Phase 0: Prerequisites and Setup

### Step 0.1: Development Environment Preparation

**CEO Action Item:**
1. Ensure you have a Mac or Linux machine (Windows requires WSL2)
2. Install Docker Desktop from https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop
3. Install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
4. Install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
5. Create accounts at:
   - GitHub.com (if you don't have one)
   - Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com)
   - Stripe Dashboard (dashboard.stripe.com)

**Verification:** Run `docker --version`, `git --version`, `code --version` in your terminal. All should return version numbers.

### Step 0.2: Secret Management Setup

**CEO Action Item:**
1. Create a file called `SECRET_VAULT.md` in a secure location (NOT in the project folder)
2. Create a password-protected document or use a password manager
3. You will collect 47 different API keys and secrets during this process
4. Each time you see "Add to Secret Vault," immediately add the new secret to this file

**Verification:** Confirm you have a secure place to store secrets.

### Step 0.3: NLyzer Documentation Library Preparation

**CEO Action Item:**
1. Ensure your NLyzer-Documentation-Library folder is accessible
2. It should contain subdirectories like `06_External_Services/stripe-python/`
3. If missing, download from your secure location

**Verification:** Confirm you can see the documentation library folder structure.

### Step 0.4: Project Repository Initialization
