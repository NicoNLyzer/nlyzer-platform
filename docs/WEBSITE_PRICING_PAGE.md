Your service continues until the end of your billing period.

Most Professional customers stay within their 500K search limit. 
Usage is predictable and correlates with your business growth.

customization needs, and service level requirements. Pricing typically 
ranges from $2,000-$10,000/month for full enterprise features.
```

**Q: Do you offer revenue-sharing pricing?**
```
A: Yes! For marketplace platforms and large retailers, we offer performance-based 
pricing models where you pay a percentage of incremental revenue generated 
through visual search.

Professional: 10,000 API calls/hour
